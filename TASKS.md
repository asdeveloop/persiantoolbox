# TASKS

Real execution status for PersianToolbox (derived from `tasks-next/*.md` and runtime verification).

- Last updated: 2026-02-27
- Task completion: `24/24` DONE (`100%`)
- NP0 completion: `10/10` DONE (`100%`)
- Deploy gate policy: all NP0 must be `DONE`
- Current deploy gate result: **PASS** (all NP0 tasks are DONE)

## Reality Notes

- VPS runtime is healthy and production deploy run `22475517488` completed successfully (`2026-02-27T06:40:24Z`).
- Local release readiness is tracked with generated artifacts under `docs/deployment/reports` and `docs/release/reports`.
- Current enterprise release gate status is dependent on full `release:rc:run` passing on latest commit.
